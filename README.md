## About PyOR
The author developed PyOR while he was a postdoc at École Normale Supérieure, Paris, purely for pleasure—simulating NMR Maser/Raser and helping individuals from physics, chemistry, and biology backgrounds learn and simulate NMR experiments. PyOR is written in Python because it is free and accessible.

PyOR will be helpful for beginners with a basic understanding of matrices, spin operators, and Python programming who are interested in coding magnetic resonance pulse sequences and relaxation mechanics. It can also be used to teach undergraduate and graduate students about NMR.

Finally, beware of numerical errors!
