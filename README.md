# PyOR (Python on Resonance)
**Dedicated to Jean Jeener (My hero in NMR, whom I have never met) and Gauri (My inner chaos, the birthplace of confusion, envy, and jealousy - the soul and catalyst of PyOR)**

**_"Lost in the solitude of his immense power, he began to lose direction. He felt scattered about, multiplied, more solitary than ever." - Gabriel Garcia Marquez, One Hundred Years of Solitude._**

**Motto: "Everybody can simulate Magnetic Resonance"**

## About PyOR
Python On Resonance (PyOR) is a versatile magnetic resonance simulation package developed in Python using an object-oriented design. Originally created to model nonlinear NMR phenomena such as radiation damping and maser effects, PyOR has evolved into a user-friendly tool for both beginners and advanced users. It supports the simulation of a wide range of magnetic resonance problems in both liquid-state and solid-state NMR. As an open-source project, PyOR offers full transparency, allowing users to clearly see how textbook equations are transformed into executable code. A comprehensive collection of example notebooks is provided as Jupyter Notebook files, enabling users to quickly begin simulating and exploring NMR phenomena.

Finally, watch out for numerical inaccuracies and potential errors in equations!
