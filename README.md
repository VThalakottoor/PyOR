# PyOR (Python on Resonance)
Current Version: Jeener-0.9.0

Motto: "Everybody can simulate NMR"

## For users
1. I am still working on documentation
2. Look at the default parameters (which will be printed on calling the PyOR module) and choose the "MatrixTolarence" parameter before starting the simulation.
4. Radiation damping is removed and will be back in the version Jeener-1.0.0
5. Beware of numerical error
6. There can be mistakes in the equations, especially in the relaxation part. If you see any errors please write to me.
7. More example files will be uploaded in the future.
8. For any questions and suggestions email me.

## About PyOR
I developed PyOR during the early stage of my postdoc at École Normale Supérieure, Paris, purely for pleasure, to simulate NMR masers/rasers and assist individuals from physics, chemistry, and biology backgrounds in learning and simulating NMR experiments. PyOR is written in Python because it is free and widely accessible.

PyOR is particularly useful for beginners with a basic understanding of matrices, spin operators, and Python programming who are interested in coding magnetic resonance pulse sequences and relaxation mechanics. It can also serve as an educational tool for teaching NMR to undergraduate and graduate students.

Finally, watch out for numerical inaccuracies and potential errors in equations!
