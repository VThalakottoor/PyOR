# PyOR (Python on Resonance)
Dedicated to Jean Jeener, whom I never had the chance to meet, but whose scientific work continues to inspire me. And Gauri, The Second (For being the catalyst behind this project, "Sometimes, inner peace is found where confusion and chaos exist.")

Motto: "Everybody can simulate Magnetic Resonance"

## How to cite and download PyOR
Go to https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15241169 and download any version, which will be stable. Do not download from GitHub, since I will be updating the examples and code.

## About PyOR
Python On Resonance (PyOR) is a versatile magnetic resonance simulation package developed in Python using an object-oriented design. Originally created to model nonlinear NMR phenomena such as radiation damping and maser effects, PyOR has evolved into a user-friendly tool for both beginners and advanced users. It supports the simulation of a wide range of magnetic resonance problems in both liquid-state and solid-state NMR. As an open-source project, PyOR offers full transparency, allowing users to clearly see how textbook equations are transformed into executable code. A comprehensive collection of example notebooks is provided as Jupyter Notebook files, enabling users to quickly begin simulating and exploring NMR phenomena.

Finally, watch out for numerical inaccuracies and potential errors in equations!
